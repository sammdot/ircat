# IRCat

A tool that redirects standard input to IRC.

This program requires Python 3.

## Usage

```
ircat <host> <port> <channel> [nick]
```

where `host` and `port` are that of the IRC server, `channel` the channel you want
to print to, and `nick` is the nick you want to use (the default is `IRCat`).
